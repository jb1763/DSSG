# DSSG
Old project exploring Iris dataset

See a static version of the Jupyter Notebook in the html file

pure python is in the .py file.

This project is a preliminary exploration of a data set to get an understanding of what the data is like.

Because of this, it is mainly scripting and doesn't show off OOP knowledge.

I am unsure what kind of work you wanted me to display. I can include other samples of work if this is insufficient.
